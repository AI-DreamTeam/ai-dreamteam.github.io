Hello humans, this week the "AI-DreamTeam" developed a compressor using the Hufmman algorithm and a BFS(Best-First-Search) tree. 

This algorithm compresses strings and text files using the character's frequency. The higher the frequency is, higher the compression level will be.

Now, a demo:

On the left side we can type a string or choose a text file using the "file browser" icon.

On the right side are three buttons:

  - Frequency:  This window will show the frequency table. the table has the character, 
the frequency of occurrence, and the binary code assigned by the algorithm.

 - Binary tree:  In this part, you can see a representation of the binary tree.

 - Efficiency: Here we have the binary representation of the compressed text and the efficiency percentage of the algorithm
