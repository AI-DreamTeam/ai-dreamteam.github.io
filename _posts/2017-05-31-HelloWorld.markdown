We are the AI-DreamTeam. A small group of passionate programmers and future software engineers wanting to change the world, one AI at the time. We come from many different backgrounds, and with many different points of views. 

Over the next 8 weeks, we will be posting here our progress from our AI class at ITESO. Here's a little bit about ourselves:

### Kevin Castro 
I love sing all the time and everywhere. The videogames are my passion and my favorite art expression. I like to do exercise for eat as much as I can. I really enjoy learning about new web technologies. I want to have all gadgets to complement my smart devices (thanks XXI century). My favorite author is H.P. Lovecraft.  

### Felipe Escoto
I am a Web Developer at Wizeline and Linux Desktop Developer for <a href="https://elementary.io">elementary OS</a>. Like any other good Software Engineer, I absolutely love videogames. I like to use my free time to make apps; currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/Philip-Scott/Notes-up">Markdown Notes manager</a> and a native <a href="https://github.com/Philip-Scott/Spice-up">PowerPoint-like app</a> for Linux.

### Adri√°n Toscano
I like playing videogames a lot (what a surprise), especially RPGs and story driven action games. I also enjoy reading, listening to music and playing the drums. I'm currently an intern at <a href= "https://github.com/signalab"> Signalab ITESO</a>, where I work on a few Python scripts and provide general support at the laboratory.
